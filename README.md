# Simulation-to-Optimize-Functionality-of-Emergency-Rooms-
We live in a country where immediate access to top-notch healthcare is viewed as a given - despite oneâ€™s ability to pay or level of health insurance. With such high expectations and demands for healthcare, Hospital Emergency Rooms (ERs) are nearly always busy with wide ranges of emergencies and non- emergencies alike. Further, as the population, average lifespan, and insurance costs increase, we expect ERs will become even busier. So, if ERs will become busier, then how can we make them more efficient? We have two goals in this paper. First, we must accurately model an emergency room. We do this by taking real-world input data, applying it to a model, then comparing the results to real-world averages to ensure that our model achieves real world-results (based on the real world data). Secondly, we attempt to improve upon our base model by implementing improvements proposed by our reference paper (see reference A), where emergency departments are divided into two components, emergencies and urgent care. This second goal is where we attempt to answer our original question of how to make emergency room operations more efficient (given certain staffing/space requirements).
